# User Churn Analysis (SQL)

A portfolio project analyzing user churn using SQL.  
This project demonstrates SQL query design and data segmentation.

---

## Project Overview

- **Business Question:** Why are users leaving the platform, and what patterns can we detect?  
- **Definition of Churn:** A user is considered churned if inactive for 90+ days.
- **Goal:** Identify churn drivers, present insights clearly, and propose actions to reduce churn.

---

## Tools & Skills

- **SQL**: data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation.   
- **Data Analysis**: cohort analysis, segmentation, retention trends.  
- **Portfolio Focus**: translating raw queries into actionable insights.

## Repository Contents
  
- `queries/` – folder with key SQL queries used in the analysis.  
- `README.md` – project overview (this file).

## Key Insights

- Cohort 30: 7.5%, 7.0%, 12.0%
- Cohort 87: 25.0%, 32.0%, 49.0% 
- Early-life churn (first 30 days) is most critical. Users will generally know if they want to continue the service within the first 30 days.
- Cohort 30 shows strongest retention, a potential best-practice model.

## Churn Trend (Jan–Mar 2017)
